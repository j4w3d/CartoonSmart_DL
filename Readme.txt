CartoonSmart Downloader

Cartoon Smart Downloader is designed for users whom have a yearly subscription to be able to download individual courses in a quick and effective manner to allow for offline viewing. 

Users still have to have a Yearly Subscription to access the files, Also Allows for users to be able to download any resources within certain lessons as well.

Please feel free to adjust and put in pull requests as is my contribution to some great lessons out there but for those with limited resources whilst out of network communications.

To Install Requirement:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

See program help:

	python cartoonsmart_dl.py -help

Donâ€™t forget to go settings.py in change username and password.
